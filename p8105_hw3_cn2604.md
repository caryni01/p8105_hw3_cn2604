# Problem 2

The dataframe after cleaning processes has 6 variables and 50400
observations. It includes the week and day variables with an indication
of either weekday or weekend. Each one minute interval is turned into a
variable named activity_number and activity_counts is the new variable
for original activity data.

# Problem 3

The raw dataframe of ny_noaa has 7 variables and 2595176 observations.
It has weather station id, date of observation, precipitation, snowfall,
snow depth, and maximum and minimum temperatures. For data of
precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth, there are 145838, 381221,
591786 missing values. For tmax and tmin, all of the observations are
missing, which generates no helpful information for further analysis.

1.  While most of the observations for snowfall are missing, 0 mm is the
    most commonly seen value in the remaining observation. It is
    reasonable because snowfall is an occasional event in that area and
    no snow should be observed in normal days.
